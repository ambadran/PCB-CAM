# PCB-CAM

This is a Python program that takes in Gerber files and outputs Gcode files to manufacture the PCB using laser or spindle engraving.

It also supports simulating the tool path easily.
It can also generate drilling Gcode, and PCB cutting Gcode.

(This is my 2nd implmentation of a custom PCB CAM software for my PCB-Manufacturer Project https://github.com/ambadran/PCB-Manufacturer)
