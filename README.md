# PCB-CAM

This is my 2nd implmentation of a custom PCB CAM software for my PCB-Manufacturer Project https://github.com/ambadran/PCB-Manufacturer

The first implementation was a do-everything-from-scratch approach :)

However, this meant that with every pcb I discovered new corner cases I needed to implement.

This time, I'll be using shapely python library, which should handle all the possible trace shapes for me.
